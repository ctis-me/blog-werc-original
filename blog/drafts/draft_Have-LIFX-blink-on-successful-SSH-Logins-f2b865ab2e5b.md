### Have LIFX blink on successful SSH Logins

*Because blinkenlights are the most effective way to audit security,
apparently.*

It recently dawned on me that the enormous gaping hole in my being was
the result of my plain old 60w incandescent bulbs, so when the
opportunity to indulge my consumerism with something far more
over-engineered finally presented itself, I jumped at the chance to pick
up a few used
<a href="http://www.lifx.com/products/color-1000" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">LIFX Color 1000s</a>
for fairly cheaply. 

Of course, the functionality of the lights themselves (vivid colors and
shades of white, control with an app) are neat, but I was much more
interested in the remote control capabilities. Thankfully, LIFX have
provided developers with a
<a href="https://api.developer.lifx.com/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">wonderful REST API</a>
with which one can add all kinds of integrations to other services. Yes,
we’ve reached a point where an individual can request OAuth credentials
for their lights. What a time to be alive. 

With this in mind, I set out to integrate my lights into something I
would actually want notifications for, and the first thing that came to
mind was having them blink softly whenever a user logs into one of my
servers via SSH.
