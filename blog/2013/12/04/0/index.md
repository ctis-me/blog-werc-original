Introducing **Self Esteem as a Service**!

It’s a compliment generator for when you just can’t come up with
something nice to say to somebody.

The compliment database currently contains 64 unique compliments that
are randomly selected and displayed. This number will continue to
increase at a rate of ten or so per day, as I come up with them. My goal
is to reach 200+ compliments soon, so if you have ideas or a bunch of
compliments, help is appreciated

Also, I’m starting work with David dodge on a new type of generator that
actually randomly forms sentences from individual words. That’ll bring
even more fun randomness and uniqueness to the page!

The page, as it is being developed, will live in
/other\_versions/development/happy. Its not going to be fully
functional, or finished, until it moves out of there.

Fun!

Update: its 100% finished now, but compliment donations are always
welcome!
