### Stopping Google Analytics Spammers

Any observant user of Google Analytics will have undoubtedly noticed a

This is worrying! Not only does it completely destroy any chance of
getting actual, valid traffic data from Analytics, but it also
frustratingly puts your website’s data at the hands of internet
spammers. Ouch!  
   
 So here’s a quick tip for stopping the (unfortunately) prevalent Google
Analytics spammers from your site.  
   
 First, delete and re-add your website to Analytics to get a new
property ID, and retrieve your new tracking code.  
   
 Next,

to keep bots from finding your site’s analytics property ID. I’ve been
using this method for several months now and can confirm that it has no
effect on the functionality of analytics and doesn’t break anything.
