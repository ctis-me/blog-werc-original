Have you ever been browsing your favorite online forum or social media
website, when suddenly, you see the perfect opportunity to make a
reference to your *absolute favorite meme?*

Have you ever proceeded to throw your hands up in anguish when you
suddenly realized that, nowhere in your extensive collection of images,
copypasta, and everything in between, could you find that one, perfect
ASCII banepost that would have made the *perfect* reply?

Well then I’ve got the perfect software for you.

I’ve tried countless other programs, but none of them flied so well, and
some of them even crashed my computer, with no survivors!

Ultimately, I became so distraught by the lack of free, open source
software to solve this problem that I decided to create my own
implementation of everyone’s favorite Big Guy,
<a href="https://gist.github.com/ctrezevant/175d098088b71b823450" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor">Banepost.c</a>,
which I guarantee is better than any competing version (at least it can
talk).

It didn’t matter who I was, what mattered was my plan, and that was to
start a fire in the open source copypasta community that would not only
tell you about Bane, but also why he wore the mask. If this were some
grand crime, then getting caught is most certainly a part of my plan,
and I wasn’t alone in this effort.

There are many eager young developers in the OSS with a fire in their
hearts which rises as they find themselves Completely In Agreement with
this effort, and that will undoubtedly lead them to create their own,
high quality copypasta generating software.

Enjoy!
